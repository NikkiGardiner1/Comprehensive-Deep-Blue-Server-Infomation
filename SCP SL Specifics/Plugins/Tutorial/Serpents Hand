Serpents Hand:
Serpents Hand has a 25% chance to spawn during a Chaos Spawn Wave.
This puts you as a tutorial, with a Crossvec, Chaos Insurgency Hacking Device, Flash Bang, Radio, Medkit, and Combat Armor
This role works with SCPs only. Meaning that your targets are any Foundation Members and Chaos Members.
This will also prevent the game ending when there is only SCPs and Chaos, meaning they too need to be killed.

SH Spawns at the small indent across the GateB Elevator.
