This section is the section regarding all of the other gameplay altering plugins, but nothing that should have its own section.

Better Sinkholes: At 4 ways in light containment, there is a chance for a sinkhole to appear, do not walk into the middle of it. They go far deeper than you expect.

Candy Weight: What a nice strawberry flavored piece of candy.

Autonuke: 25 Minutes before the big bomb goes off. Radiation is so fun too!
