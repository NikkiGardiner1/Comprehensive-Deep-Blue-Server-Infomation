Friendly Fire is enabled on Deep Blue. This is meant to make teams when they are together to be more concious of what is going on to ensure that they dont accidentally kill their teammates, instead of being a swarm. Remember Friendly Fire isnt Friendly.
Feel free to kill eachother at round end however.
