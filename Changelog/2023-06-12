Added a "tutorial" section to explain the differences with the more heavily modded stuff. This is found in SCP SL Specifics -> Plugins -> Tutorial.
Upped the amount of people who spawn in during a Serpents Hand and a UIU Respawn Wave to 15 (to match normal spawn waves): This is to prevent people from missing out on spawnwaves.
The PB-42 can now open Keycard only doors, but cannot open locked doors (so if 079 traps you still get punished, and he cant get nuked at the beginning of the game)
Hopefully fixed custom zombies not spawning in.
Hopefully added ammo for the Chaos Phantom's main weapon
