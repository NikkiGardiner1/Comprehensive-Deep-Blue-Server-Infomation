Updated SH again.
	If someone can test this that would be great. End Conditions has been disabled to see if the SH config for SCPs and Chaos cannot win together works.
Part 2 Electric Boogaloo
(Staff Only) added more predefined ban reasons.
Fixed: SCP-079 not being able to talk to humans as Exiled has been updated from 7.0.0-rc3 to 7.0.0-rc5
Added "Ethics Committee Plugin Helper" which is given out by me (Snivy Films) for anyone who goes out of their way to help test plugin changes, report plugins not fully working.
	This is a discord and ingame role. For discord anyone can get it, but for the ingame role only non-staff members can get it.
	Has the same functions as VIP. If you're a VIP and qualified for Plugin Helper. Ask me to swap your role ingame.
	This role color will appear over VIP on discord.
	If you want to hide your tag type: hidetag in the player or ra console. (This applies to VIPs as well)
Ethics Committee Member (VIP) has their color adjusted on the discord to match the one in game.
Etichs Committee Chairwoman has her color adjusted on the discord to match the one in game.
