Makeshift UIU is gone. (Custom Units)
Real UIU is in


UIU has been disabled, no one has fun when they spawn in the void. It will be reenabled when fixed

Hopefully this has been fixed

Below is the loadout for each rank of UIU operatives
UIU Leader (Equivalent to MTF Captain) loadout:
Facility Manager Keycard
TG-119 (Tranq)
ADATS (Grenade Launcher)
Medkit
Adrenaline

Heavy Armor

UIU Agent (Equivalent to MTF Sargent) loadout:

Combat Armor

UIU Soldier (Equivalent to MTF Private) loadout:
Sargent Keycard
AK
Medkit
Flash Bang
Radio
Frag Grenade
Combat Armor

Oh and footnote, if anyone has any ideas to name these custom weapons, let me know, because it appears that outside of the recently renamed grenade launcher, all custom weapons has 119 in them, which lets be real, is boring, so I want to change that
