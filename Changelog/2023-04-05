Some small changes.
Custom Roles specific:
Medic. Now has a 15% chance to spawn during a spawn wave. This will take a slot of a MTF Sargent. Only 1 can spawn per wave. Health has been set to 120 (something something medical experience can allow them to take more hits I guess)
Demolitionist. Now A. CAN SPAWN, and B. has a 10% chance to spawn during a spawn wave. This will take a MTF Sargent spot. Only 1 can spawn per wave. Health is at 110 HP. DOES NOT HAVE ANY KEYCARD! Keep with your team or you can get stuck at gates specifically. Has a GL-119, Heavy Armor, 5 Grenades, and a Radio

Custom Item specific:
The Auto Gun: Now has a 1% chance to spawn. With this pistol you can hit anyone on the map for 25 damage. Its very strong, can snipe computer entirely, It is also the only gun in the server that will not harm teammates. Hence the reason. I wont tell you where to find it though
C4: Can no longer spawn. Its broken as is so why have players waste a spot for a broken item
The Medi Gun: HOPEFULLY it actually heals people and not kills people. (Sorry Gamma Omega), This needs testing which Im willing to entertain later today


Ideas that I want feedback on: 
Remove the EMP Grenade from spawning on the map, we have the Ghost Light for that duty, while there are minor differences between the EMP Grenade and Ghost Light, they are very close to each other functionally. The EMP Grenade is planned to be able to still be part of the Medic's kit. Currently the EMP Grenades has 1 guaranteed spawn somewhere on the map (Not joking when I said somewhere, see image attached)
Remove the Implosion Grenade from spawning on the map, to what I can tell. Its broken, I need to test it though, if tests confirm if it is broken, it will be removed, if it works fine, then it will remain.

Other feedback is apricated as well. Thanks
