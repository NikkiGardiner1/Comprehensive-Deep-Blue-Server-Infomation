Custom Weapon Changes:
	ADATS: 
		Reduced the clip from 4 to 2, hopefully to reduce the amount of accidental team kills
		Increased the weight of it.
		Adjusted the spawn chance of it spawning on the map naturally (Nerf)
		*They removed the flag to make impact grenades set to true or false :(*
			Footnote, if they add a flag to have grenades be rolling for a fuse time instead of impact I will enable rolling grenades and increase the grenade count to 3

	SCP-127:
		Removed from rotation entirely
			It only did damage to teammates, which is only really useful on D-Class on D-Class teamkilling
			This includes removing it from the Chaos Phantom's kit.

	Abyssal Retributor:
		Adjusted the spawn chance of it spawning in Heavy Armory (Nerf)
			This is to match the spawn chance of it spawning in MicroHID room
		Added SCP-049 Armory as a room it can now spawn in, same % chance of spawning
		Enabled Friendly Fire for this gun (I have no idea why it was disabled, probably debugging issues that I failed to set back)

	SCP-2818:
		Added a 10 % chance of spawning in MicroHID
			This is due to it actually doing damage unlike it did in SCP:SL 12.0 (Mimicry)

	Silent Serenade:
		Set "Friendly Fire" to true, I have no idea if this will cause teammates to be tranquilized

	C4:
		Now has a farther range with the detonator, this is to help stratagy in farther ranges.
		Now explodes when the deployer dies instead of being stuck in a state of limbo
		Remember its .detonate in the [~] player console to set them off.

	Autogun:
		Now has a higher range
		Now has more bullets (5-10)
		Now does less damage
		*Still has it 1% chance of spawning in 2 locations so don't worry being too overpowered

Custom Role Changes:
	Chaos Phantom:
		No longer spawns with SCP-127
		Reduced the chance of spawning at the beginning of the game
		Decreased the active time of invisibility with .special to match the same invisibility time as SCP-268 (which is a nerf for the .special ability by half)
		When you are spawned in as a Chaos Phantom you SHOULD not be teleported again to another Facility Guard spawn point, hopefully this reduces the amount of times players get killed within 5 seconds of the game starting

	MTF Demolistionist:
		Reduced the spawn chance
		You no longer teleport to another MTF spawn position when being given this role (hopefully)

	All Custom Zombies:
		*HOPEFULLY* fixed the issue of them not spawning

	MTF Medic:
		Reduce the spawn chance
		Remember it has a .special ability
		You no longer teleport to another MTF spawn position when being given this role (hopefully)

GitHub changes:
	Updated both Custom Items and Custom Roles in SCP SL Specifics -> Plugins -> Tutorial to match the changes above
	Added Autonuke to SCP Sl Specifics -> Game Functions (how did I leave that out?)

Discord Changes:
	Added Dank Memer because Adummyguy wanted it (to give #bot-commands a purpose)
	CedMod bot has some commands for #bot-commands
	When ever Serperior Pinging Services is online, you can use its commands in #bot-commands
	Changed #rules to #rules-and-resources
		added resources which as a whitelist for VPNs & Cloudgaming for CedMod, how to access the panel for ban appeals and stuff, and so on.

Somethings in the pipe that I am thinking on adding (and possibly paying some developers to make just for Deep Blue):
	MicroHID when used on players makes them evaporate, just like the 3-X Partical Distruptor
	173 spawns back in Light Containment Zone
	A new surface so we aren't using publicly availible schematics, this is to help Deep Blue stand out with their surface rework.
	Added CedMod and Map Editor Reborn to SCP Sl Specifics -> Plugins



Some Stats for the Stats people:
	Since introducing CedMod last week there has been:
		112 instances of Friendly Fire, the majority of this is end of round Friendly Fire (which is okay) and accidental team kills/cross fire
		37 People flagged for team killing that tripped the Friendly Fire Detector or has been manually banned by staff (not including DNT users)
		8 Uses of the ingame report system
		190 "Unique" players has joined (goes up each time a new player joins the server)
		The Highest Level obtained currently level 12, with 100 kills, 75 deaths, and 2 Friendly Fire Incidents



That's it, I fell asleep on my keyboard while making this.
