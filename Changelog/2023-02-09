mvp stuff was added, pretty much tells you who did the most of what, like the most kills as SCPs, etc.

Custom escapes has been added. D Class, along with detained members of the Foundation side (Scientists, Facility Guards, etc) can go to the door by the gate that opens when the CI van spawns to become Chaos

Custom escapes are disabled for now
