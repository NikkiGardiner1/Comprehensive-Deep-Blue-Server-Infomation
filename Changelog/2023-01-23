Added Common Utilities:
- Gambling is now a thing with coins
- The colors has been changed when nuke is started
- After the nuke is canceled on surface the lights turn red (this is a glitch that Entourage and I are too lazy to change)
- Class D has a 25% chance to spawn with coins, and a lesser change to spawn with other stuff
- SCP-049 can use "V" to talk to humans, just like how 939 could pre Mimicry <- False Info
- Don't be in 914 in rough, seriously, regardless of role
