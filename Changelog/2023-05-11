MVP Utility has been removed. Outside of being borderline unfunctional before the update, now a lot of inconsistencies are coming up, and given the fact that it has been discontinued by its plugin developer, there's no reason on keeping it. If there is enough outcry for it to be returned Ill do it, but until then there is no reason to keep it
